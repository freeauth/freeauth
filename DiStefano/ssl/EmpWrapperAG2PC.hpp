/**
   EmpWrapperAGC2PC. This class contains a series of wrapper functions
   for interacting with the EMP toolkit's authenticated garbling (AG).

   This class primarily exists to make it easier to call code that interacts
with EmpAG2PC, but without adding extra overhead.

   This class is structured so that you may instantiate certain portions of it
   in stages. This is designed to move certain parts of the preprocessing stage
   before the TLS handshake, as in our tests this was rather expensive compared
to the mere cost of running the circuit (as one might expect).

   Please note that using this class requires you to have a clear
conceptualisation of which party plays which role in your protocol. The exact
usage will depend on your circuit too, as EMPAG2PC allows one to have different
outputs depending on the party. We typically stick to the prover playing "Alice"
and the verifier playing "Bob", but this is just our convention.

   Usage-wise, this class should model how one might use EmpAGPC. We provide a
series of builder functions that return the right circuit for a given file path
(or you may specify the right class using an argument). The initial
preprocessing can be carried out by calling do_preproc(), which in turn can be
granularised by calling do_preproc_indep() and do_preproc_dep(). Running the
actual circuit is done via calling the appropriate running function.
