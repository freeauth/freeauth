/**
   @brief StatefulSocket. The primary usage for this class is to allow one to
more neatly express socket lifetimes by binding them to a wider scope. In other
words, this class acts as an RAII wrapper around POSIX sockets. This is
primarily to get around how C++ doesn't have standardised networking yet.

   We borrow some terminology from the wider networking community when
discussing this class. We refer to a socket that is bound to a particular
address and port as a _server_ socket. Please note that server sockets must bind
to their address and port before communications can take place. By contrast, we
refer to a socket that connects to a bound address as a _client_ socket. The key
distinction here is that the client does not need to bind to a particular socket
or file descriptor: instead, this is handled by the operating system directly.

   @remarks Please note that this class only supports the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol
   families. You can find a more complete list of the protocol types that POSIX
sockets support <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html">
here </a>. This is primarily for ease of implementation: supporting any more
than two protocol families would require us to introduce a more complicated
mechanism for flow control (e.g a State pattern or similar).
