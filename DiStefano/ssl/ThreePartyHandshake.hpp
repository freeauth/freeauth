/**
 * @brief ThreePartyHandshake. This namespace contains a series  of functions
 *for doing TLS 1.3 Three Party Handshakes.
 *
 * This namespace is a bit weird. This is to get around certain quirks / design
 *choices in BoringSSL. For example, BoringSSL makes it really hard to overwrite
 *fields that have already been set-up (which is a good thing!) but it makes it
 * difficult for us to do a three-party handshake.
 *
 * To get around this, we re-use parts of BoringSSL to do the handshake.
 * Precisely, we establish a connection between the prover and verifier,
 * generate the keyshares on the prover and send the shares to the verifier in
 * application data. The verifier then takes those key shares and uses
 * BoringSSL's key establishment code to compute their part of the local shares.
 *
 * @remarks Note that we have to use a C-style OOP construct here. Precisely,
 * functions like three_party_handshake_comm() have to take their owner as a
 * parameter. This is because C doesn't have implicit "this" sadly. This also
 * means we can't use other C++ features like exceptions (everything has to be
 *an error code).
