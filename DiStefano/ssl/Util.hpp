   @brief Util. This namespace contains a series of utility functions for
interacting neatly with various parts of BoringSSL. This is primarily to make it
easier to write code that abstracts out some of the harder details around how
data is packed and transferred.

This namespace also contains some useful utility functions for other parts
of the project. These primarily relate to data conversions.

 static assert against this field.
   2. Then when this is set to false, the code will fail to compile.
