   @brief TLSSocket. This class acts as a wrapper around StatefulSocket, but
with a binding to a SSL object. This is primarily to ensure that the lifetime of
the SSL object (along with the file descriptor) is bound to a more
strongly-scoped object.

   This class is actually a rather small wrapper around the much larger
StatefulSocket. To reduce the code bloat here, we publicly inherit from
StatefulSocket. This allows most of StatefulSocket's operations to be used here
too, and we only need to override certain functionality to enable the messages
to be encrypted.
